- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChrisLMWebb
- 👀 I’m a BSc Computer Science and Math student at Nelson Mandela University. 
- I have 10-years of experience flying aeroplanes and teaching people to fly aeroplanes but I am relatively new to coding - it is a skill I have always wanted to learn.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mainly C#, HTML, web assembly.
- 💞️ I enjoy puzzles and solving problems.
- 📫 My goal is to transition from Aviation to Tech - any advice, insight, or mentorship would be more than welcome.
